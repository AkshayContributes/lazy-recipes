            <li>Take a small frying pan and grease it with butter, making sure the butter doesn't get charred.</li>
            <li>Crack open an egg keeping the yolk intact. The fresher the eggs the better. Alongside put two slices of bread to toast in a pan or a toaster.</li>
            <li>Season the egg with some pepper and salt.</li>
            <li>Once the eggs are done with the yolk still runny put a slice of cheese on it and let the cheese melt.</li>
            <li>Carefully place the egg-cheese on the toasted bread and make a sandwich of it</li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
